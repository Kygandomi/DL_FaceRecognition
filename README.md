# DL_FaceRecognition

We have taken 5 videoes of 5 people. Each video is 1 min long. These videos are parsed at 30 fps to get 9000 frames.
The frames that are parsed are then saved in individual folders, where the folder names are their labels. 
A Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is made to identify the faces of the team members.
